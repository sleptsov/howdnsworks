  # Episodes
  ep1:
    7: "СТОЯТИ!"
    8: "Компʼютери та інші пристрої спілкуються за допомогою IP-адрес для ідентифікації один одного в Інтернеті."
    9: "Але люди не можуть запам’ятати IP-адреси, тому використовують слова."
    10: "Система доменних імен (DNS) об’єднує ці два напрямки та доставляє вас до місця призначення."
    11: "Ось як працює DNS"
    12: "Почекай! Що? Новий запит для мене? У цього хлопця немає нічого кращого, ніж сидіти в інтернеті цілий день."
    13-1: "Дозвольте мені спочатку перевірити, чи знаю я про dnsimple.com, перш ніж знову дратувати операційну систему"
    13-2: "*зітхання*... нічого"
    14: "Гей, ОС! Ти тут? Мені потрібна швидка послуга. Ти знаєш, де я можу знайти dnsimple.com?"
    15-1: "ЗАЙНЯТИЙ_АЖ_ГАЙ_ГУДЕ"
    15-2: "Резервне копіювання"
    16: "будь-будь ла-а-а-сочка? Можеш перевірити?"
    17: "Перевіряю..."
    18-1: "Ніт. Я не знаю, де це..."
    18-2: "...Але я знаю, кого запитати..."
    19: "RESOLVER"
    20: "І браузер, і ОС спочатку перевірили свій кеш, щоб перевірити, чи знають вони IP-адресу dnsimple.com. Але оскільки вони цього не зробили, ОС викликає resolver'a."
    21-1: "Хто цей таємничий resolver? Що він робитиме?"
    21-2: "Дізнайтеся у наступному випуску "Як працює DNS"."

  ep2:
    9: "A new request for me? A-W-E-S-O-M-E"
    10: "dnsimple.com? Sure thing!"
    11: "Checking my cache first..."
    12-1: "Not there!"
    12-2: "How can I find this website?"
    13: "Let's ask the root!"
    14-1: "The resolver server is usually your ISP (Internet Service Provider). All resolvers must know one thing: where to locate the root server."
    14-2: "Resolver"
    15: "The root server knows where to locate the .COM TLD server. TLD stands for Top-Level Domain."
    16-1: "Ladies and gentleman, welcome to flight R0XX to the root server. The weather is..."
    16-2: "Not my kind of road trip!"
    17: "A few milliseconds later..."
    18-1: "Thank you for flying with us. We hope to welcome you on board again."
    18-2: "Finally!"
    19: "Oh boy! I hope root is here!"
    21: "Who's there? What do you seek?"
    22-1: "Will the resolver find his way to dnsimple.com?"
    22-2: "Find out in the next episode of how DNS works."

  ep3:
    4: "NEXT!"
    5: "NNNEEEEXXXXT!!!"
    6: "What can I help you with?"
    7: "Root, I am trying to locate the IP address for the website dnsimple.com..."
    8: "Do you know where I can find it?"
    9: "Sorry resolver. I don't know where to find dnsimple.com."
    10: "But I can tell you where to find the .COM Top-level domain server!"
    11: ""
    12: "But first, I'll store this information, so I don't have to ask the root again."
    13: "This root server is just one of the 13 root name servers that exist today."
    14: "Root servers sit at the top of the DNS hierarchy."
    15: "They are scattered around the globe and operated by 12 independent organisations."
    16: "They are named [letter].root-servers.net where [letter] ranges from A to M."
    17: "This doesn't mean that we have only 13 physical servers to support the whole internet!"
    18: "Each organisation provides multiple physical servers distributed around the globe."
    23-1: "Not my kind of road trip"
    23-2: "But we are now here..."
    24-1: "How will the .COM TLD server help our friend the resolver?"
    24-2: "Find out in the next episode of how DNS works."

  ep4:
    3: "Well, it's much more comfortable than I imagined..."
    4: "...What do you do when they recommend 'room temperature' for certain drinks?"
    6: "Sorry! I am looking for dnsimple.com, do you know where I can find it?"
    7: "Now, that's a great question!"
    8: "The coordination of most top-level domains (TLDs) belong to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)"
    9-1: "The .COM TLD was one of the first created in 1985."
    9-2: "And today, it is the largest TLD on the internet."
    10-1: "Other type of TLDs include:"
    10-2: "1. Country code TLDs. Usually, their 2 letter ISO code."
    11: "2. Internationalized country code TLDs."
    12-1: "3. Generic TLDs: .NET, .ORG, .EDU, etc..."
    12-2: "Usually, TLDs with 3 or more letters."
    13-1: "4. Infrastructure TLDs: .ARPA, mostly used for reverse DNS lookups."
    13-2: "The opposite of what we are doing now."
    13-3: "We are doing this:"
    13-4: "Reverse DNS does this:"
    14: "And today, many new generic TLDs are being created!"
    15: "Now, back to your question resolver!"
    16: "I am afraid I don't know the IP address for dnsimple.com"
    17: "But I have found the name servers!"
    18: "Great! I'll store that information for later"
    20: "The .COM found the authoritative name servers for the domain dnsimple.com."
    21-1: "But what do these names mean?"
    21-2: "We'll find out very soon..."
    22: "So the journey continues..."
    23-1: "Who are the authoritative name servers?"
    23-2: "Find out in the next episode of how DNS works."

  ep5:
    2: "How could the .COM TLD server point me to the authoritative name servers?"
    3: "How could he make the connection? There are so many .COM domains!"
    4: "Easy! With the help of the Domain Registrar!"
    5: "When a domain is purchased, the domain registrar reserves the name..."
    6: "... and communicates to the TLD registry the authoritative name servers."
    7: "We have arrived!"
    8: "Papers, please!"
    9: "Oh! I'll be quick. I have no intention of staying here. I am looking for ns1.dnsimple.com."
    10: "Papers, please!"
    11: "Oh boy! The only thing I have is a request for dnsimple.com. The .COM TLD told me that ns1.dnsimple.com could tell me where I could locate the IP address."
    12: "Well, in that case..."
    13: "I am ns1.dnsimple.com"
    14: "And I can provide you with that answer!"
    15: "Currently there are 4 of us that know how to resolve any domain managed by dnsimple.com"
    16-1: "We provide answers to DNS queries: Websites, e-mail, ..."
    16-2: "We are the ultimate authority on this stuff."
    17: "No cached values. Not asking someone else. Only the real deal."
    18: "You see, usually there is more than one name server attached to any domain."
    19-1: "You, the resolver, you are given this list in some unknown order."
    19-2: "You might query the first name server in the list."
    19-3: "OR NOT! We have to be ready!"
    20-1: "Because there is more of us, the work load is better distributed."
    20-2: "And the DNS zone availability is increased."
    21: "Especially in case of a failure!"
    22-1: "So if you want to know who are the authoritative name servers for your domain, run a WHOIS query."
    22-2: "There are a few websites that provide this information."
    23: "So here you go: 50.31.213.210"
    24: "What?"
    25-1: "dnsimple.com IP address is: 50.31.213.210"
    25-2: "Anything else?"
    26: "Uh, no. Thanks!"
    27: "I guess I'll save that."
    28: "The resolver finally got the answer he was looking for! Hurray for the Authoritative name server!"
    29: "Time to go home!"
    30-1: "Will the resolver make it back home in time?"
    30-2: "Find out in the next episode of how DNS works."

  ep6:
    3: "JETPACKS"
    4: "It was so cool visiting everyone!"
    5: "The root told me where to find the .COM server."
    6: "The TLD server gave me the Authoritative name servers addresses."
    7: "Then, ns1.dnsimple.com gave me the IP for dnsimple.com."
    8: "Finally, here we are, I can now deliver the answer."
    9: "JETPACKS"
    10: "Resolver! It's about time! I have been waiting a few milliseconds now. I thought you were lost!"
    11-1: "Hi OS! I'll tell you about my trip later."
    11-2: "Here is your answer..."
    12: "dnsimple.com IP address:"
    13: "Great! I'll save this so I don't have to bother you again if he asks for dnsimple.com."
    14: "Did someone mention me?"
    15: "Yes! Quick! Ask 50.31.213.210 whatever you need."
    16-1: "Finally! I was considering displaying one of those funny gifs to entertain my audience while you were away."
    16-2: "Oh, well, maybe later."
    17: "Connecting to 50.31.213.210"
    19: "Hi! Could you please send me your HTML content?"
    20: "Sure thing! On the way!"
    21: "Here we go..."
    24-1: "It's getting late."
    24-2: "I'll watch that last video on youtube."
    25: "Youtube? That, I know where to find!"
    26: "Well, we have completed our journey and this story is coming to an end."
    27: "We hope you have enjoyed it!"
    28: "Don't be a stranger! We're on twitter."
    29: "Thank you for reading!"
    31-1: "Is that it? Is this the end for real? No way!"
    31-2: "There is one more Bonus Episode!"
    31-3: "Read Bonus Episode"

  ep7:
    1: "Wait..."
    2: "Something is missing here!"
    3: "How could the resolver find 'ns1.dnsimple.com' before 'dnsimple.com'?"
    4: "Since 'ns1.dnsimple.com' is a subdomain of 'dnsimple.com', how could we resolve 'ns1.dnsimple.com' without resolving 'dnsimple.com' first?"
    5: "Isn't the search going backwards?"
    6: "Wouldn't we get stuck in a loop at some point?"
    7: "For example, let's say that the authoritative server for domain.com is ns1.domain.com"
    8-1: "If I wanted to browse domain.com, the .COM TLD would tell me to get the IP address from…
